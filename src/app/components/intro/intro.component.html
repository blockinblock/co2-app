    The <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tehg_2011/" target="_blank">Treibhausgas-Emissionshandelsgesetz (TEHG)</a> 
    lays the foundations in Germany law for an emissions trading system as directed by the 
    <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32003L0087" target="_blank">EU Emissions Trading Directive (Directive 2003/87/EC)</a>
    and requires that certain facilities (such as factories and power stations) are registered and provide annual reports on their emissions.
