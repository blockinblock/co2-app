# CO2-app

Angular, Angular Material and OpenLayers demo showing energy facilities and their CO2 equivalent emissions. Facilities data is provided from the Berlin Umweltatlas via WFS
and rendered using OpenLayers and the ngx-charts framework.

## Note
This repo is purely for demo purposes only and will not be maintained. The implementation is tightly coupled with the incoming WFS data from Stadt Berlin, meaning that the app will need to be adjusted if the incoming data structure changes.

## Versions

Angular/Material v8.2, OpenLayers v6.12, ngx-charts v13.
